## Experiment-1:Create a new process by invoking the appropriate system call. Get the process identifier of the currently running process and its respective parent using system calls and display the same using a C program.
## Experiment-2:Identify the system calls to copy the content of one file to another and illustrate the same using a C program.
## Experiment-3:Design a CPU scheduling program with C using First Come First Served technique with the following considerations.
